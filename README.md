# Morbius
"Morbius" addresses the challenge of accurate disease diagnosis based on symptoms using machine learning and AI. Traditional diagnostic methods can be prone to error and inefficiencies, especially across diverse diseases and symptoms. Our project aims to improve diagnostic accuracy by developing a system that clusters diseases based on symptom similarity and predicts specific diseases within these clusters. This approach enhances early detection, treatment planning, and healthcare outcomes, contributing to global efforts for better health and well-being.
